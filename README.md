CS-230-T1120 Operating Platforms 22EW1

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
<p> The Gaming room contacted Creative Technology solutions looking to expand and scale their game application Draw it Or lose It to other operating platforms. </p>

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
<p> I believe I laid out The Gaming Rooms requiremtns and provided a solid evaluation and made sound reccomendations for this client. </p>

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
<p> Working thorugh the design document really helped me to understand the requirements and end gold of applicaton. This helps to create the whole picture and was exteamly
helpful when developing the code. </p>

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
<p> The one part of my document I would revise or refine would be the evaluation diagram. I would like to refine it to be more specific about the different systems
and their requirements. </p>

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
<p> In order to interpret the customers needs its critical to gather as many and as clear of details as possible from the customer. Not leaving anything up to actual interpretation 
or guessing what the customer wants will ensure that you are meeting the needs of the client. Putting in the effort up front in the infomation gathering stage will also ensure that there 
is no need to go back and redo or rework aspects of the application because you found out later on what the customer actually wanted. </p>

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
<p> My approcah to designing software is to gather as much informaiton as possible up front. I like to lay out a plan and use diagrams such as UML or pseudocode. 
This gives a template to work off of and makes it much more efficient than just coding off the cuff. I would sugguest this stratagy for all developers working on 
large or small project and plan to use them in the future. </p>
